/**
 * AdSense HTML Verification File Handler
 * 
 * When AdSense says "Try another method", they'll give you an HTML file like:
 * ads-verification-1234567890abcdef.html
 * 
 * Place that file in /public/ folder and it will be accessible at:
 * https://metals.svacron.com/ads-verification-1234567890abcdef.html
 * 
 * INSTRUCTIONS:
 * 
 * 1. Go to AdSense Dashboard
 * 2. Click "Try another method"
 * 3. Choose "Upload HTML file"
 * 4. Download the HTML file they provide
 * 5. Place it in /public/ folder (e.g., public/ads-verification-12345.html)
 * 6. Commit and push to deploy
 * 7. Click "Verify" in AdSense
 * 
 * The file should be directly accessible at:
 * https://metals.svacron.com/[filename].html
